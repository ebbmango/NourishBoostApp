[] Disable recipes for now. They are completely glitched.

[] If I press and hold any buttons on the food/entry details screen, their explanation should expand.

[] Colour the calendar picker with the application's theme.

[] Invert the scroll direction in the foods/recipes list.

known issues:

1. In EntryEditScreen.jsx and FoodDetailsScreen.jsx:
   Changing the selected table index every time ANY change happens in the database.
   In the future, it would be good to change this to happen in case ONLY of deletion or flagging (flag as deleted (isDeleted = 1))

2. No transaction handling.
